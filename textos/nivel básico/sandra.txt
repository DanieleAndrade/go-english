Sandra is very beautiful, young, and successful. She’s a famous actress. She’s also very rich. Her house near the beach is big and beautiful, and her car is very expensive. Her fans love her. But is she happy?

Sandra says, “yeah, I’m young, rich, beautiful, and famous. People think rich people are happy. That’s not always true!“

Sandra’s brother, Mike, is her manager. He says, “Sandra is only 18. She enjoys acting and entertaining people. But she’s not happy. She doesn’t like being famous.“

“It’s true,” Sandra says. “I’m never alone. Reporters are everywhere. Wherever I go, they’re there. They’re outside my house all the time! That’s so annoying!“.
